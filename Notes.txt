Selenium Hybrid Framework(Python,selenium)

tools-used
(Python, Selenium, Pytest, Page Object Model, HTML Reports)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

--> What is framework?

Framework is an organized way of maintaining automation files.
In the framework all the files will communicate each other to perform certain task.


--> Why framework?

1) Re-usablity
2) Maintainablity


--> types of framework?

1) Built-in frameworks
	pytest, robotframework,unittest etc...

2) Customized/User defined frameworks
	Datadriven framework, keyword driven framework, Hybrid driven framework


* To work on framework we have to go through different stages/phases

Phases:
-------------------
Phase-1 : 

## Analyse application, technology and skill set of team, choose test cases

100 TC's.....

decision about the tools to be used
Re-test cases(test data)->data driven test cases  
Re-gression cases
TC's can be automatable

100 % automation?? --> This is not possible because some of the tests
cant be done like (captcha,report,..etc), this type of the test needs
the manual tests done so 100% automation is not possible, if the mentioned
tests or all the tests are done through automation and its working correct 
then we can call it as 100% automation


Phase-2 : 

## Design & implementation of the framework

Phase-3 :

## Execution

Phase-4 :

## Maintainence(Version Control System)
